Katharevousa (Greek Καθαρεύουσα) was a literary style of Greek common in the 19th and 20th centuries that was designed to mimic the grammar and vocabulary of Ancient Greek while still being understandable to speakers of Modern Greek. As such, it contains features like accent marks and the dative that were lost in the modern vernacular language.

The Greek-Greek dictionary included in this app is a dictionary with headwords in Ancient Greek and definitions in Katharevousa Greek. While at first this may seem improper, the two languages are incredibly similar once you adjust for a few changes (detailed in 'How to Read Katharevousa') and should quickly become comprehensible to anyone familiar with the ancient language.
